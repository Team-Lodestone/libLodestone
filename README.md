# libLodestone
NOTICE: Work will not be happening in the `main` branch until our Internal Format is completed.   
To see the latest commits to this project, please take a look at the [internal-format branch](https://github.com/Team-Lodestone/libLodestone/tree/internal-format/).

Provides reading, writing, and format conversion for most editions and versions of Minecraft.

LCE formats will be handled by [libLCE](https://github.com/DexrnZacAttack/libLCE), once bindings are made for it.

## Roadmap
Coming soon
